## Design

### Colors

When selecting the color scheme for my latest project, I aimed for something distinctive. In my previous four projects, I opted for a straightforward design with muted colors. However, this time, I chose to embrace adventure! Following online research, I discovered that adventurous color palettes complement travel blog sites, making the decision a clear choice. After a brief Google search for 'Adventurous color combinations,' I settled on 'Teal' and 'Mustard' with subtle black accents. This choice imparted a bold personality to my site, of which I am genuinely proud.

### Fonts

Google Fonts was implemented on the site. I used Source Code Pro as the primary font and sans-serif as the fallback throughout the entire site. Source Code Pro, renowned for its popularity among coders, offers visual comfort and a broader character width tailored for optimal screen reading.
